# EpicChat

I have always wanted to go to the speakers' corner in london.

so I started this project in hope of turning it online.

**STACK :** *MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS* 

[Live](https://epicchat.herokuapp.com/)

The completed project should be something like this:
* *A room with three video chats, Two Sides and an organizer.*
* *People join and view the discussion and upvote the side that makes more sense.*



## Current Version

* Authentication and Authorization.
* Chat feature and Chat rooms (Socket.io).
* Cool Animations (FramerMotion)


## Wanted Features 

* Video Chat rooms
* Upvote feature.
* Add a timer so that every side gets its fair chance of talking.
